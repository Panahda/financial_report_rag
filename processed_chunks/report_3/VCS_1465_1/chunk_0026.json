The monthly readings of import & export are jointly recorded by DISCOM and Suzlon (on behalf of PP) and the same is provided in the joint meter reading (JMR) statement. Based on the GSS reading and PSS reading of each feeder, the Suzlon apportions the export & import reading for each project owner as per the procedure given in the MR and provides the apportioned import & export in monthly share certificate. The apportioned procedure mentioned in MR is correct which is confirmed by recalculating the final values form PSS & GSS reading. The net electricity supplied to grid by project WTGs are calculated difference between apportioned export & import value provided in the share certificate. The same values are considered for the ER calculation. ORPPL: Controller Reading: Each WTGs of ORPPL are equipped controller energy meter which records the energy generation readings of respective WTG continuously. Similarly, WTGs other proponents in the same location (which are not part of this project) are metered through theâ€™ respective WTG controllers. The energy generation readings of all WTGs are recorded monthly by ReGen. GSS Reading: At the Government substation (GSS), an energy meter is installed which records the bulk reading of all the WTGs (project & non-project WTGs) at the injection point. The monthly readings of import & export are jointly recorded by DISCOM and ReGen",
