The excel sheet is clear, un- protected and easily viewable. The calculation in the excel sheet is verified and found be correct. The methods and formulae set out in the project description for calculating baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage are correctly followed in the monitoring report and ER calculation sheet.\n\nAll the values are provided in the MR and ER calculation sheet are cross verified with its sources and confirmed no manual transposition errors between data sets have occurred. Also the consistency of values within MR is checked and found to be OK.",
