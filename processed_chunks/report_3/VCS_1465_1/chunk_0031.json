The meter numbers & accuracy class of energy meters are reconfirmed during site visit. The monitoring period falls within 5 years of the initial calibration date. Hence, the calibration done for the energy meters is valid for throughout the monitoring period.\n\nw\n\n17\n\nThe accuracy class of energy meters installed in the project is 0.2s which is more accuracy class than the minimum accuracy class mentioned in the validated VCS PD ie, 0.5s. Hence, the accuracy of energy meters installed is found to be OK.\n\nThe validation team conclude that the evidence used to determine the emission reduction is of sufficient quantity and appropriate quality. Hence the emission reduction calculated for the monitoring period is accurate.",
