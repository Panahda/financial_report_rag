However igi i ; and for the Jaisalmar site it is done at 400 kV substation. station has been corrected with | Specific and exact specication in the | revised monitoring report. and OJWEPL is 400kvV. The same is now reflected in the | section 3.3 of the MR. the bulk meters are installed are now modified in the MR. This is as : - However, in the validated PD also the substation details are wrongly mentioned as 220 kV substation as location of bulk meter. Hence, PP has explained the same in section 2.2.2 of MR as deviation from project description. The same is validated and found that the deviation does not affect applicability of methodology, baseline and addtionality of the project. CAR-04 is closed CAR 05 MR-Section 3.2: It is mentioned that the EG tacility, will be calculated from import, export & transmission loss. However as verified form site, EG tacitityy calculation does not involve estimation of transmission loss The transmission loss is nowhere | separately accounted.
