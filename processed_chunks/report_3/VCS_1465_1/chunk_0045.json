The section 4.4 of the revised MR has | been updated with justification of increase in emission reductions from the one as expected in VCS-PD. It is to be noted that the increase in generation has happened due to the increase is generation from the expected PLF in the PD. It is to be understood that the PLF increase is within the limits of sensitivity and such variation in PLF can be expected because PLF is estimated for the lifetime of the project and some years can be definitely favourable. After the correction in the generation, the difference between emission reduction achieved and estimated value comes to 10.48%. This increase in emission reduction achieved due to increase in energy generation during the monitoring period. As checked with the O&M operator, the energy generation during the monitoring period is slightly higher due to the increase wind flow days in the project area. It is also noticed from the validated PD that the IRR will reach the benchmark only = when _ the generation increase to 29.90% for OJWPL and 31.6% for ORPPL",
