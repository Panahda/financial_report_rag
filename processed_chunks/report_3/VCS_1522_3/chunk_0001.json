The geographical coordinates of the project extension limits are 5°48'33\" W, 6°39'28\" S (Northernmost point of the dam) and 5°46'56\" W, 6°36'55\" S (Easternmost point) which has been verified from the Location finder /08/.\n\nThe project activity is composed of a run-of-river hydropower plant with a capacity of 270 MW anda micro-hydro power plant of 5.35 MW generating capacity with a total estimated average gross electricity generation of 1,170 GWh per year, fed by a 17.3 km? reservoir. The plant is connected via three 225 kV transmission lines to the national grid: the transmission line Soubré-Buyo, Soubré-San Pedro and Soubré-Taabo. The technical specification of the turbines/alternators and the installed capacity of the project activity has been verified during the remote interview/physical site visit and also from the photos of the Turbines/alternators /09/.",
