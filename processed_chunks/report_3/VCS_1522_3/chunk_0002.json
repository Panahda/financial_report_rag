Thus, GHG emission reductions can be achieved.\n\nThe project activity is operational since commissioning of first unit and during current monitoring period i.e. from 01/07/2022 - 30/06/2023, the project activity has supplied 1,509,806 MWh net electricity to the grid, there by resulted in emission reduction of 912,224 tCO2e. The monitoring period subject to this monitoring report is inclusive of first and last day of period\n\nA risk based approach has been followed to perform the 4) periodic verification of the project activity. In the course of the verification, 01 Corrective Action Request (CAR) and 00 Clarification (CL) were raised.",
