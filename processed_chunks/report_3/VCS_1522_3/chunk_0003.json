The calculation and determination of GHG emission reductions from the project is the responsibility of the management of the AERA Group. The development and maintenance of records and reporting procedures are in accordance with the Monitoring Report Version 1.3 dated 15/02/2024.\n\nv vcs\n\nVerification Report: VCS Version 4.2\n\nIt is our responsibility to express an independent GHG verification opinion on the GHG emissions and on the calculation of GHG emission reductions from the project for the period 01/07/2022 - 30/06/2023 based on the reported emission reductions in the final monitoring report Version 1.3 dated 15/02/2024 for the same period.\n\nBased on an understanding of the risks associated with reporting GHG emissions data and the controls in place to mitigate these, 4KES planned and performed our work to obtain the information and explanations that we considered necessary to provide sufficient evidence for us to give reasonable assurance that this reported amount of GHG emission reductions for the period is fairly stated.",
