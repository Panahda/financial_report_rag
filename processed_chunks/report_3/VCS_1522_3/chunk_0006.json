The VCS projects must undergo an independent third-party verification and certification of emission reductions as the basis for issuance of Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs).\n\nThe objectives of this verification exercise are, by review of objective evidence, to establish that:\n\nthat:\n\ne The project activity has been implemented and operated as per the project description (PD) and that all physical features (technology, project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the project are in place;\n\ne Monitoring report and other supporting documents are complete;\n\ne The data is recorded and stored as per the monitoring methodology and approved monitoring plan.\n\ne To confirm that the monitoring system is implemented and fully functional to generate Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs/VCUs) without any double counting, and\n\ne To establish that the data reported are accurate, complete, consistent, transparent and free of material error or omission by checking the monitoring records and the emissions reduction calculation.",
