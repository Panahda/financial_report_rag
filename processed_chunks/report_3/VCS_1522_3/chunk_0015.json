This is done based on the desk review and Microsoft Teams remote interview/Physical site visit. The verification team prepares and/or updates a verification protocol (internal document) that records the conformities and non- conformities, which may be of following types;\n\nCAR (Corrective Action Request) is raised if one of the following occurs:\n\ne Non-compliance with the monitoring plan, the methodology or the standardized baseline are found in monitoring and reporting and has not been sufficiently documented by the project participants, or if the evidence provided to prove conformity is insufficient;\n\ne Modifications to the implementation, operation and monitoring of the registered project activity has not been sufficiently documented by the project participants;\n\ne Mistakes have been made in applying assumptions, data or calculations of emission reductions that will impact the quantity of emission reductions;",
