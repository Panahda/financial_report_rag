Therefore, no methodology deviations are applied during the monitoring period. The verification team confirms that no deviations were observed during the current monitoring period.\n\n1 https: cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV14 7617167 7.04/view\n\nVv vcs\n\nVerification Report: VCS Version 4.2\n\n3.3 Project Description Deviations\n\n[already formalized and approved at previous verification]\n\nThe technical details of Turbines/alternators installed under the project activity is different than the registered VCS-PD /05/. Section 3.2.2 of the MR /1.2/ has been filled accordingly. Verification team has verified the capacity of the project activity from the name plate photo of the turbines/alternators /O9/ and found consistent. The impact of the change in project capacity has been checked and verification team confirm that the deviation does not impact the applicability of the methodology nor the appropriateness of the baseline scenario. Since the change in the capacity is within 10%, which is already considered in the VCS-PD /05/ as part of the sensitivity analysis. Hence the deviation does not have any impact on the additionality of the project activity and project is still additional.\n\n[identified in the current verification - although pre-existent]",
