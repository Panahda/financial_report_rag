  "content": "Ex-ante emissions reductions were calculated based on an estimated ‘sold electricity’ average of 1,170 GWh/y * 0.9 (applying such 0.9 discount factor to conservatively account for auxiliary consumptions and losses from net power generation assumption of 1,170 GWh/y) at time of (CDM)PDD registration, which lowered expected emission reductions by 10%. However, such losses between gross power plant generation and delivery sub-station exports are actually less than 1%, and irrelevant to the emission reductions since already accounted in the net metered energy at substation anyway. Considering this change with respect to registered VCS PD /05/, section 3.2.2 of the MR /1.2/ is filled accordingly which is found OK. Corrections do not affect the scale, baseline or the additionality of the project and hence accepted to the verification team.",
