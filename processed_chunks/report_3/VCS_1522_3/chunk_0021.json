List of documents reviewed during the course of verification is presented under Appendix | of this report.\n\nThe selected monitoring period i.e. 01/07/2022 - 30/06/2023 (both days included) is within the 1st crediting period i.e. 25/05/2017 to 24/05/2027 which is accepted to the verification team. As per the registered VCS-PD /05/, the expected start date of the project activity was 01/01/2017 however the commissioning of the first turbine occurred on 25/05/2017 /10/, hence the start date/crediting period start date has been revised to 25/05/2017 which is accepted to the verification team.\n\nThere was no major breakdown or shutdowns during the monitoring period which might affect the applicability of methodology or might cause material errors in emission reductions.\n\nThe assessment team confirmed that there is no proposed or actual change to the project design during this monitoring period except deviations as mentioned under section 3.3 of this report which do not affect the scale, baseline or the additionality of the project and hence accepted to the verification team.
