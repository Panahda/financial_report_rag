Verification team has checked the calculation from the monitoring report /1.2/ and the ER calculation sheet /2.2/ and found correct.\n\nSDG Target 13.0: The project, in the current reporting period has resulted in emission reduction of 912,224 tCOze. Verification team has checked the calculation from the monitoring report /1.2/ and the ER calculation sheet /2.2/ and found correct.\n\nThe emission reduction achieved during the current monitoring period i.e., from O1-July-2022 to 30-June-2023 is 29% higher than the ex-ante estimation for the same period, i.e. 706,914 tCO2e.\n\nThis is due to (i) equipments availability (thanks to good maintenance), (ii) increasing power demand from the grid, and (iii) upstream water releases from Buyo dam (due to in-operational group) /26/. Further Hydro generation is unexpected i.e. based on the water availability and not in the control of PP.",
