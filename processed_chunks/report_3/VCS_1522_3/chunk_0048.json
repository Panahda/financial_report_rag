  "content": "4.5 Quality of Evidence to Determine GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\n\nAll relevant documents were checked to assess the correctness and quality of data submitted by the project participants, which are used to determine emission reductions.\n\nAll records needed for monitoring are archived in line with the requirements of the registered monitoring plan /05/. No significant lack of evidence and missing data were detected during desk review and Microsoft Teams remote interview/Physical site visit. Hence, the verification team confirms that the monitoring system ensures required quality of the monitoring system to ensure the quality of the monitored data. All internal data are subjected to QA/QC measures. The monitoring parameters have been measured / determined without material misstatements and is in line with all applicable standards and relevant requirements. The information inflow (from data generation, aggregation, to recording, calculation and reporting) is included in section 4.4 under each parameter and confirms to the requirement of the PD /05/.\n\nIt was also verified that the plantâ€™s team involved in the monitoring of project activity is well experienced. Hence, the verification team concludes that competent staff is employed by the project proponent to carry out the relevant tasks with sufficient accuracy.",
