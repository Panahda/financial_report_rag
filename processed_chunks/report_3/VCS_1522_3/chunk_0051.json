The GHG emission reductions were calculated correctly on the basis of the approved baseline and monitoring methodology ACMO002- Version 16.0 and the VCS standard.\n\nVerification period: From 01-July-2022 to 30-June-2023\n\nVerified GHG emission reductions and removals in the above verification period:\n\nBaseline Project emissions Leakage Net GHG emission emissions or or removals emissions reductions or removals (tCOze) (tCOze) (tCO2e) removals (tCO2e) From 01/07/20 22 to 462,548 - - 462,548 31/12/20 22 From 01/01/20 23 to 449,676 449,676 30/06/20 23 Total 912,224 - - 912,224\n\nThe comparison of the estimated ex-ante GHG emission reductions and removals and the achieved emission reductions and removals for this monitoring period are reported in the below table.\n\nEx-ante emissions Achieved emissions Percent Justification for reductions/removals reductions/removals difference the difference 01- The actual July- emission From +31% | reductions are 2022 |) From ; to 01/07/2022 01/07/2022 AEREE higher than the 30- /O7/ 353,457 to , estimated ex- to ante emission June- 31/12/2022 reductions for 2023 31/12/2022 same period. 449,676 +27% | This is due to From From 353,457 01/01/2023",
