Further Hydro generation is unexpected i.e. based on the water availability and not in the control of PP. As per the registered IRR excel sheet /06/, the additionality breaching point for the power generation is +34.2%. Since the generation is 29% higher during this monitoring period which is less than +34.2%, project is still additional with the higher generation. Hence verification team confirm\n\nthat higher generation do not have any impact on the project additionality\n\n32\n\nVv vcs\n\nVerification Report: VCS Version 4.2\n\nand project is still additional. The same is accepted to the verification team.\n\nApproved by\n\nChandrakala R.\n\nDirector\n\nDate: 16 February 2024\n\n4K Earth Science Private Limited\n\nPlace: Bangalore, India\n\n33\n\nVCs\n\nVerification Report: VCS Version 4.2",
