PP need ion has been calculated on conservative basis for the delayed period.\n\nProject participant response\n\nDate: 12/02/2024\n\nBased on the already provided calibration certificate, indeed the error identified in the delayed calibration test is beyond the maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment. Thus, paragraph 366 (b) of CDM validation and verification standard for project activities version 03.0 is applied. Therefore, the applicable error of 0.204% was conservatively deducted for the period going from 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2022 (% of error available in the Annexe 1.2 - page 2 from the calibration details file of G1- of the year 2021). It is the only error higher than the permissible error of 0.2%.\n\n36\n\nVCs\n\nVerification Report: VCS Version 4.2\n\nDocumentation provided by project participant\n\nMR\n\n“G1” PDF file\n\nDOE assessment",
