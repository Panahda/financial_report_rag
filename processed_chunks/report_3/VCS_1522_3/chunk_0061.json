Last calibration of the energy meters was done on 18/02/2021 and latest calibration was done in December 2022. Since the calibration was delayed, PP has applied the maximum error 0.204% identified during the latest calibrations (December 2022) /23/ for the period from 01/07/2022 to 31/12/2022 and monthly electricity export and import has been corrected accordingly. The same is verified from the revised ER sheet /2.2/ and revised MR /1.2/. Verification team has found the approach conservative and hence accepted to the verification team.",
