  "content": "The objective of verification is to verify and certify the Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) generated by the Project from 02/12/2008-27/07/2010.\n\nVCS Version 3 Program and UNFCCC criteria refer to Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM rules and modalities and the subsequent decisions by the CDM Executive Board, as well as the host country criteria.\n\n1.2 Scope and Criteria\n\nThe verification scope is defined as an independent and objective review of the VCS Project Description (VCS-PD), the Project's baseline study and Monitoring Report (MR) and other relevant documents. The information in these documents is reviewed against VCS Version 3 requirements, UNFCCC rules and associated interpretations.\n\nThe verification is not meant to provide any consulting towards the client. However, stated requests for forward actions and/or corrective actions may provide input for improvement of the Project monitoring towards reductions in the GHG emissions.",
