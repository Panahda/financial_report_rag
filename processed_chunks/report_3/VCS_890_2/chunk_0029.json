The data pertaining to the above parameter are maintained in the identified records. All the data are in compliance with that stated in the Monitoring Report version 02.\n\nAs per the methodology ACM0002 Version 9 \" and the VCS-PD Â©, the emission reductions for the Project are calculated as the baseline emissions minus the project emissions. Hence the emission reduction is determined by the following formula:\n\nER, = BE,-PE,- Ly\n\nWhere,\n\nERy: Emission reductions\n\nBE,: Baseline emissions\n\nPE,: Project emissions\n\nLy: Leakage",
