UNFCCC criteria refer to Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the host country criteria.\n\nThe verification scope is defined as a periodic independent review and ex post determination by the Designated Operational Entity of the monitored reductions in GHG emissions during defined verification period, and consisted of the following three phases: i) desk review of the project design and the baseline and monitoring plan; ii) follow-up on-site visit and interviews with project stakeholders; iii) resolution of outstanding issues and the issuance of the final verification report and opinion. The overall verification, from Contract Review to Verification Report & Opinion, was conducted using Bureau Veritas Certification internal procedures.",

(hereafter referred to as “the PP”) and is located in Wengniute Banner, Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,P.R.China. The Project consists of 25 sets of wind turbine generators (WTGs) with a unit installed capacity of 2MW, providing a total installed capacity of 50MW. The annual expected electricity supplied to Northeast China Power Grid (NEPG) is 135,600MWh and the annual estimated emission reductions are 155,384tCOze.\n\nThe Project has been registered on 28/07/2010 (UNFCCC Ref. No. 3325) under approved CDM methodology ACM0002 Version 9 “Consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources’.\n\nThe Project Start Date of the VCS Project is 02/12/2008, when the first wind turbine generator started electricity generation. The crediting period for the Project under the VCS is from 02/12/2008-27/07/2010.",

The geographical coordinates of the project extension limits are 5°48'33\" W, 6°39'28\" S (Northernmost point of the dam) and 5°46'56\" W, 6°36'55\" S (Easternmost point) which has been verified from the Location finder /08/.\n\nThe project activity is composed of a run-of-river hydropower plant with a capacity of 270 MW anda micro-hydro power plant of 5.35 MW generating capacity with a total estimated average gross electricity generation of 1,170 GWh per year, fed by a 17.3 km? reservoir. The plant is connected via three 225 kV transmission lines to the national grid: the transmission line Soubré-Buyo, Soubré-San Pedro and Soubré-Taabo. The technical specification of the turbines/alternators and the installed capacity of the project activity has been verified during the remote interview/physical site visit and also from the photos of the Turbines/alternators /09/.\n\nThe purpose of this project activity is to generate clean form of electricity and the net electricity generated from this project is supplied to the national grid via the transmission lines and PPA is signed between PP and the utility company /12/.",

The same is verified from the revised ER sheet /2.2/ and revised MR /1.2/. Verification team has found the approach conservative and hence accepted to the verification team.",

It is to be noted that the increase in generation has happened due to the increase is generation from the expected PLF in the PD. It is to be understood that the PLF increase is within the limits of sensitivity and such variation in PLF can be expected because PLF is estimated for the lifetime of the project and some years can be definitely favourable. After the correction in the generation, the difference between emission reduction achieved and estimated value comes to 10.48%. This increase in emission reduction achieved due to increase in energy generation during the monitoring period. As checked with the O&M operator, the energy generation during the monitoring period is slightly higher due to the increase wind flow days in the project area.
